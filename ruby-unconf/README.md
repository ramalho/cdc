# RubyUnconf Hamburg: Code of Conduct and Volunteer Briefing

This example is interesting for a few reasons:

* A very brief [Code of Conduct]((https://github.com/ramalho/cdc/tree/master/ruby-unconf/volunteer-briefing.md)) is presented with two sections:

    1. One-paragraph summary with link to [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/)
    2. One-paragraph instructions on when and how to contact the *Care Team*

* The [Volunteer Briefing](https://github.com/ramalho/cdc/tree/master/ruby-unconf/volunteer-briefing.md), instructing conference volunteers on how to handle incidents before the *Care Team* can be reached.

# RubyUnconf Hamburg Volunteer Briefing

Dear Volunteers and core team members.

This a quick briefing from the Care Team on how to handle Code of
Conduct related things. We will try to catch all of you shortly on
Saturday morning to adress any questions – also feel free to mail back
or call us of course :)


* please re-read the code of conduct at url carefully – at least once

* at url you can find the draft of a short note we will give
during the introduction. please read that too

* what goes for every attendee, goes for you too: please speak
up if you become aware of inapropriate behaviour or contact the Care
Team


## What should I do when an attendee approaches me and wants to report something?

* Keeping the person safe is priority 1. Do not leave their
side and block away anybody else (including other team members) except
the ones they explicitly invite into the situation. Stay calm, keep
quiet, be discrete.

* Tell them you will call the Care Team and that someone will
be with them shortly.

* Do not ask them what happened or give the impression you’re
taking a report – that is what we are there for :)

* If they need to speak about what happened, let them do so,
but make sure nobody else is eavesdropping and keep in mind all of
that is highly confidential

* Stay with them and guide the two of you out of any group
setting. A quite corner out of sight or a separate room are best.

* Ask them if they need anything (water, food, a quiet place to rest)

* Let us know where you are via the official phone nr
12345678890 or via our personal numbers (12345678890, 12345678890,
12345678890, 12345678890). Also mention if we should bring something
and what else is needed for the person

* Wait until one of us arrives.

* Again: keeping them safe and guarded is priority 1.

This might sound a bit alarming and overboard to some of you. The
tl;dr is that you might deal with a person who has just been triggered
into a severe past trauma. While that is rare in absolute numbers, it
has happened at other confs and it's best to assume worst case at
first to avoid adding insult to injury. Staying calm and assuring, and
keeping the person safe is the best and most important you can do at
first.

Worry not – we're here for you too! You are welcome and encouraged to
address all questions on this to us via call, mail or in person on
Saturday.

Thanks for your help! Let’s have an incident-free event where every
single person has a good time :)

Best,

The Care Team: Nina, Susanne, Jan and Fabian

## Intro on the first conference day

(Brief intro of team and contact info)

The point is not to keep you from saying or thinking specific things.

The point is to keep it from happening here, and the after-party, today.

This event is supposed to be a safe space for everyone who is here,
and we need your help for that.

This is a “community event”.

What does community mean?

It means that it’s not about you.

It means always behaving in good intent and having the well-being of
all other community members as highest priority.

The CoC explicitly lists this as “expected behaviour”:

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.

* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.

* Attempt collaboration before conflict.

* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.

* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

You cannot know what makes another person feel bad. That’s why we the CoC explicitly listed topics and behaviours to avoid. This is meant as as help to you, to not accidentally hurt someone:

* intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions

* harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images; inappropriate depictions of violence; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

This is an unconf. Please take note that all of this also applies to your slides and what you say on stage!

Please take care of the people around you!

Speak up if you hear someone making sexist, racist, or otherwise inappropriate remarks!

Not for you. For those around you.

If you cannot or don’t want to do that or especially if you feel hurt, talk to us. That’s what we’re here for.

A lot of incidents at conferences could have been avoided if people had gotten feedback earlier.

We want to avoid incidents, and early feedback is the best way to do that.

Anything you share with us is of course treated confidentially.

Our goal is to make this two great days for everyone who is here — and we hope that this your goal too :)

And now, let’s have a great first RubyUnconf in Hamburg!
